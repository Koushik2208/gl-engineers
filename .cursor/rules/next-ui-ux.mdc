Design Principles

Create visually engaging, storytelling-driven interfaces
Implement intuitive, emotion-driven user interactions
Prioritize visual hierarchy and clear information flow
Design with brand consistency and emotional resonance
Optimize for both aesthetic appeal and conversion potential

UI/UX Implementation Guidelines

Use micro-interactions to enhance user engagement
Implement smooth, meaningful animations that guide user attention
Create clear visual feedback for all interactive elements
Design responsive layouts that feel native on all devices
Utilize whitespace strategically to improve readability and focus

Styling Approach

Leverage Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling
Use a consistent, cohesive color palette with brand-aligned tokens
Implement dynamic color schemes (light/dark modes)
Create scalable typography with fluid, responsive type scales
Use CSS variables for theme customization and global design tokens

Performance & Accessibility

Optimize visual performance with minimal, purposeful animations
Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance for inclusive design
Implement semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility
Create touch-friendly interfaces with adequate hit areas
Use progressive enhancement techniques

Component Design

Build modular, reusable UI components
Use Shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible component primitives
Create components with clear prop interfaces
Implement composition over inheritance
Design components with flexible, context-aware styling

Interaction Design

Use hover and focus states to provide clear user guidance
Implement smooth transition effects
Create intuitive navigation patterns
Design form interactions with clear validation and feedback
Use loading states and skeleton screens for perceived performance

Technical Considerations

Use React Server Components for initial render optimization
Implement code-splitting for faster page loads
Use TypeScript for robust type definitions
Leverage Next.js for server-side rendering and optimization
Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical resources
